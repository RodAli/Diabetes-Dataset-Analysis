# Diabetes-Dataset-Analysis

In this notebook I will be exploring the relationship of age, blood pressure, and BMI on a person's skin thickness. To do this I will be comparing the means of different groups using the following statistical methods:

- ANOVA
- T-Test
- Multiple Linear Regression
- ANCOVA

The dataset can be reference [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

This analysis was done as part of the course INF2178 - Experimental Design for Data Science
